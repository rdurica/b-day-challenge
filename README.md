The B-Day Challenge Repository is a PHP web application designed to add excitement and engagement to birthday celebrations.
This interactive platform allows administrators to create and assign fun tasks and challenges for users to complete,
capturing their achievements through various media formats like videos, images, or written responses to quizzes and
queries.
